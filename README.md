Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning (sample)

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical features.

## Features Used
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type
- Resting BP, Cholesterol, Blood Sugar
- ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise Angina
- ST Depression (ECG graph), Number of Vessels, Thalassemia

## ML Models
- Logistic Regression - although it is a classification problem but we used regression
   -Logistic Regression is specifically designed for such cases. It estimates the probability that a data point belongs to a class using the sigmoid (logistic) function. 
## Models tried
- Decision Tree - overfitting issue as of now for small data set
- Random Forest - sample is small so overfitted 
- SVM - less accuracy than logistic regression
- KNN

ðŸ“ˆ Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
